This version of minchess requires that you specify the depth for each side
and the initial alpha beta search parameters.
To run type
./minchess -w <white max_depth> <white alpha> <white beta> -b <black max_depth> <black alpha> <black beta> 

Example: Running with max depth both sides at 5, and initial alpha beta of -10000 10000 
./minchess -w 5 -10000 10000 -b 5 -10000 10000

Example: Running serial version with different depths for both sides
./minchess -w 4 -10000 10000 -b 6 -10000 10000
