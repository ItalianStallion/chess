To compile the serial version type: make
To compile the openmp version type: make openmp
(Requres icc compiler and an SMP cluster)

This version of minchess requires that you specify the depth for each side
and the initial alpha beta search parameters.
To run type
./minchess -w <white max_depth> <white alpha> <white beta> -b <black max_depth> <black alpha> <black beta> -nt <max number of threads to use (openmp version only)>

Example: Running with max depth both sides at 5, initial alpha beta of -10000 10000 and 32 threads
./minchess -w 5 -10000 10000 -b 5 -10000 10000 -nt 32

Example: Running serial version with different depths for both sides
./minchess -w 4 -10000 10000 -b 6 -10000 10000

This version is optimized for the openmp version and as such suppresses most stdout output, for easier time comparison using the time command (meaning, you don't see the board state)
