/* Now we have the mailbox array, so called because it looks like a
   mailbox, at least according to Bob Hyatt. This is useful when we
   need to figure out what pieces can go where. Let's say we have a
   rook on square a4 (32) and we want to know if it can move one
   square to the left. We subtract 1, and we get 31 (h5). The rook
   obviously can't move to h5, but we don't know that without doing
   a lot of annoying work. Sooooo, what we do is figure out a4's
   mailbox number, which is 61. Then we subtract 1 from 61 (60) and
   see what mailbox[60] is. In this case, it's -1, so it's out of
   bounds and we can forget it. You can see how mailbox[] is used
   in attack() in board.c. */
