To build CHX type these commands (requires CMake)
Note: By default CHX will build with OpenMP support if your compiler supports it.
  To disable OpenMP manually run the command: (doesn't work right now, will always build it by default. Silly CMake.)
		$ cmake . -DOPENMP=FALSE

 $ cmake .
 $ make

To run type these commands

 $ cd src
 $ ./chx
You then get an interactive prompt ("chx>"). At the prompt you can run
the benchmark by typing:

    bench ../inputs/board2 3 4

This will load the board from file ../inputs/board2, and evaluate the solution to ply depth 3 and do it 4 times. The program will display the best move, as well as the time for each board evaluation, the average time, and the best time.

When the readline package is enabled, the user will be able to access command line history to edit and re-execute commands.

Command line options:
-h          Displays this help message
-w n        Sets the depth of the white side to n (default 3)
-b n        Sets the depth of the black side to n (default 3)
-o          Turns off all engine output
-e			Sets the evaluation method to simple material evaluation
-t			Sets the number of threads of parallel execution (requires a compiler that supports OpenMP)

NOTE: Setting any command line parameters will cause the engine to start making moves automatically. If you set output to off then it will appear as if the engine is hanging, but it simply not printing any output.
