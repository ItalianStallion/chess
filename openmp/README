Thanks for getting CHX!

To report any problems/bugs/comments with CHX please send an email to:
gopx@cct.lsu.edu

==================== COMPILING ====================

To build CHX type these commands (requires CMake)
Note: By default CHX will build with OpenMP support if your compiler supports it.
  To disable OpenMP manually, run the command:
		$ cmake . -DOPENMP=FALSE
  otherwise run the following command.

 $ cmake .
 $ make

If you are on a machine that has an intel compiler, use this command instead (if gcc doesn't compile successfully with OpenMP):

 $ cmake . -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=icc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=icpc
 $ make

==================== RUNNING ====================

To run type these commands

 $ cd src
 $ ./chx
You then get an interactive prompt ("chx>"). 

================= SETTING OPTIONS ================

You can use CHX with command line options or with the provided settings.ini file.
Any settings made via the command line arguments will override those provided in the
settings.ini file

NOTE: In order for the settings.ini file to read in properly, you need to be
in the same working directory as the settings file when you run the program.

==================== BENCHMARK ====================

At the interactive prompt you can run the benchmark by typing:

    bench ../inputs/board2 3 4

This will load the board from file ../inputs/board2, and evaluate the solution to ply depth 3 and do it 4 times. The program will display the best move, as well as the time for each board evaluation, the average time, and the best time.

==================== ADDITIONAL NOTES ====================

When the readline package is enabled, the user will be able to access command line history to edit and re-execute commands.

Command line options:
-h          Displays this help message
-s file     Uses the specified settings file instead of settings.ini
-w n        Sets the depth of the white side to n (default 3)
-b n        Sets the depth of the black side to n (default 3)
-e          Sets the evaluation method to simple material evaluation
-a          Sets the search method to be alpha-beta
-t n        Sets the number of threads to n
-o          Turns off all engine output

NOTE: Setting any command line parameters (except -s) will cause the engine to start making moves automatically. If you set output to off then it will appear as if the engine is hanging, but it simply not printing any output.
